# Production runtime

> [中文版](runtime-production.zh-CN.md)

## Threads

One runtime thread owns the Domain (Core), the protocol adapters and every Product callback. Separate threads exist only where a call can block on hardware.

| Thread | Owns / does | Wakes on | Stack |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hmi_app`, priority 19 | Core, protocol routing and adapters, Product `app_run`/`app_tick`/`local_action`, periodic scheduling, NVM bookkeeping, UDS server polling, snapshot publication | CAN RX, UI action, or 5 ms (1 ms with the CAN update endpoint) | 12288 bytes |
| `hmi_tx0` / `hmi_tx1`, priority 18 | One per opened bus; the only caller of the CAN driver write | Its queue | 2048 bytes each |
| `hmi_ui`, LVGL priority + 2 | LVGL, Product UI | 16 ms (50 ms while the update screen shows) | 32768 bytes by default |
| `hmi_nvm`, priority 21 | Blocking EEPROM or file I/O | Its request queue | 4096 bytes |
| `hmi_upd`, priority 25 | Flash writes of the update candidate | Its job queue | 12288 bytes |
| `hmi_wdog`, priority 26 | Hardware watchdog feed | 200 ms | 2048 bytes |

Product code never needs a lock: all callbacks except the UI factory run on the runtime thread, one after another. The host simulator runs the same sequence in one loop through `hmi_runtime_step()`.

## One runtime iteration

1. Poll the update endpoint; entering or leaving maintenance starts a new session (see below).
2. Read up to 64 frames from the opened buses. UDS frames go to the update endpoint, every other frame is routed and decoded at once; decoders write straight into Core.
3. Apply queued UI/MSH actions (`HMI_ACTION_PRODUCT` goes to `local_action`, the rest to Core).
4. `hmi_runtime_step()`: adapter `process`, Product `app_run` with the command port, signal timeouts, Product `app_tick`.
5. Encode due periodic frames from the current snapshot and queue them.
6. Apply the brightness setting to the backlight, hand changed settings to NVM, poll NVM results.
7. Publish: copy the snapshot for the UI when its revision changed, copy diagnostics for MSH.

## Interfaces between threads

| From → to | Mechanism | Depth |
|---|---|---|
| UI / MSH → runtime | `hmi_execution_action()`; returns false only when the queue is full or settings are not accepted | 8 actions |
| runtime → UI | `hmi_execution_present()`; the UI copies under the publication lock only when the revision changed | one published copy |
| runtime → TX | Ordinary queue (protocol and periodic frames) and urgent queue (UDS); at most four urgent frames before an ordinary one | 16 + 16 per bus |
| runtime ↔ NVM, update | Their own request/result queues | 1 in flight |

The publication lock (`hmi_debug_lock`) also guards the public diagnostics, so `hmi domain` and `hmi signal` read the same copy as the UI.

## Commands

`hmi_command_port_t.send()` routes a command through the Product's `command_route` to the owning adapter's `command()` and returns whether the adapter accepted it, in the same call. Transactions that wait for an answer (SDO, parameter read/write, version query) live in the adapter: it sends frames in `process`, matches answers in `on_frame`, applies its own timeouts and publishes results as signals.

## Periodic frames

A `hmi_periodic_frame_t` names the bus, identifier, length and period; `encode(snapshot, now, frame)` fills the data from the live snapshot when the deadline arrives. Freshness is the encoder's decision, based on each signal's state. One frame per entry may wait in the TX queue; a frame that has not reached the driver within one period is dropped, so a bus without acknowledgement never builds a backlog. Late deadlines skip missed periods instead of bursting. `critical` entries keep running during update maintenance.

## Sessions and maintenance

A session starts at boot and whenever update maintenance is entered or left (`update_exclusive`, an open UDS programming session, or `hmi_update maintenance on`). A new session advances the generation, marks valid signals stale, resets adapters and calls the Product's `app_reset`. Frames queued in the previous session are dropped before they reach the driver; UDS frames are not tied to a session. During maintenance received vehicle frames are counted but not decoded, `app_run` and adapter `process` are skipped, only critical periodic frames are sent, settings are rejected and the UI shows the update view. There is no degraded mode: a full TX queue only increments `queue_full`.

## Startup

The UI thread composes the Product, initializes LVGL, Core and the display, creates the Product UI and starts the runtime thread. The runtime thread first waits for the stored settings (the CAN bit rate must be known before the buses open), then opens only the buses the Product uses (routes, periodic frames, update endpoint), starts their TX threads and the update endpoint, and begins the first session. A startup failure is logged and the runtime does not start; the watchdog supervises only after a successful start. There is no runtime stop: power-down durability relies on the settings record format, and update activation waits for a durable settings barrier.

## Diagnostics

`hmi_exec` prints the generation, maintenance state, rejected actions, suppressed frames, TX queue-full count, per-bus TX ok/error/dropped counters and per-entry periodic misses and lateness. `hmi can`, `hmi runtime`, `hmi domain`, `hmi storage` and `hmi trace` are described in [diagnostics](diagnostics.md).

## Build-time Product selection

Each firmware image contains exactly one Product, selected in SCons by `CONFIG_AIC_HMI_PRODUCT_ROOT` in the defconfig; the `HMI_PRODUCT_ROOT` environment variable overrides it for one build. An empty selection stops the firmware build. Host CMake builds the Framework alone unless `-DHMI_PRODUCT_ROOT` names a Product. The selected `product/sources.json` supplies the firmware composition (`contracts/hmi_firmware.h`): three non-overlapping storages (runtime Domain, published copy, UI copy) and the locale setup.
