# Board integration

> [中文版](board-integration.zh-CN.md)

## Responsibilities

| Layer | Owns |
|---|---|
| SDK / BSP (`target/<chip>/<board>/`, defconfig) | Pinmux, clocks, panel, touch, PWM backlight channel, CAN and I2C controllers, partition table, bootloader |
| Framework Kconfig "Board resources" (same defconfig) | Which devices the application uses: CAN device per logical bus, settings EEPROM location or settings files, display layer ownership, backlight curve |
| Product | Protocols, routes, periodic frames, UI, settings catalog, update identity and UDS addressing, extra peripherals |

A new board needs a defconfig, not Framework code. A Product never names a device: it addresses CAN by role (`HMI_BUS_CAN0`, `HMI_BUS_CAN1`).

## Board resources

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `AIC_HMI_CAN0_DEVICE` / `AIC_HMI_CAN1_DEVICE` | `can0` / `can1` | RT-Thread CAN device behind each logical bus; a bus opens only when the Product uses it |
| `AIC_HMI_DISPLAY_EXCLUSIVE` | y | Turn the video layer and extra UI rectangles off and force UI alpha 255 before LVGL starts; say n when the Product shows camera or video |
| `AIC_HMI_BACKLIGHT` | y (needs `AIC_PWM_BACKLIGHT`) | Drive the SDK backlight channel `AIC_PWM_BACKLIGHT_CHANNEL` from the brightness setting; say n when the Product controls the backlight |
| `AIC_HMI_BACKLIGHT_PERIOD_NS`, `AIC_HMI_BACKLIGHT_FLOOR_PERCENT` | 20000, 10 | Duty = floor + brightness × (100 − floor) / 100 |
| `AIC_HMI_NVM_EEPROM_BUS`, `_ADDRESS`, `_SIZE`, `_PAGE`, `_OFFSET` | `i2c0`, 0x50, 65536, 128, 0 | Two-byte-addressed I2C EEPROM holding the 1 KiB settings region |
| `AIC_HMI_NVM_FILE_BACKEND`, `_PREFIX`, `_KIND` | n, `/data/meter-settings`, `nand-fatfs` | Settings as files on an already mounted filesystem instead of an EEPROM |
| `AIC_HMI_DISPLAY_GAMMA`, `AIC_HMI_DISPLAY_CCM` | 100, empty | Panel colour correction, see [diagnostics](../runtime/diagnostics.md) |

The CAN bit rate is a persisted setting (125, 250 or 500 kbit/s) shared by all opened buses; it is latched before the buses open and changes take effect after a restart.

## Display, resolution and orientation

Resolution, rotation and the touch device come from the SDK panel configuration and the SDK LVGL package options (`lvgl-ui`); the Framework does not assume a screen size. The Product UI lays itself out from `lv_display_get_horizontal_resolution()`/`..._vertical_resolution()` of the active display. A portrait variant is a different board defconfig (or Product build), not a Framework change.

The SDK sources are never edited. The UI starts inside the SDK LVGL thread through the linker option `-Wl,--wrap=lv_user_gui_init` (`main.c` runs the SDK implementation first, then starts the Product UI), and LVGL options are layered on top of the SDK `lv_conf.h` by the application. GE2D drawing is on by default; `AIC_HMI_DRAW_GE2D` switches it off for CPU-only drawing when a visual glitch needs a comparison (the UI renders straight into the scan-out buffers, so CPU and GE2D drawing share a buffer).

## Firmware update

The OS image name follows the chip (`<PRJ_CHIP>_os.itb`). The CAN update backend reads the A/B OS partition geometry from the MTD devices and requires both partitions to be identical, disjoint and free of bad blocks; it supports SPI NAND boot. The Product's update policy sets the UDS bus and identifiers (defaults CAN0, 0x7E0/0x7E8). See [CAN update](../ota/can-update.md) and [media update](../ota/media-update.md).

## Build and validation

Build with SDK OneStep as described in the [build guide](build.md); keep the image, ELF/map and the generated `output/<project>/hmi/` headers with the evidence. A successful build or host test does not establish display, touch, physical CAN, durable storage or update acceptance on the board.

## Build isolation

The SDK still shares one active `.config`; build different targets sequentially. The LVGL port stages corrected sources and their objects under `build/<PRJ_NAME>/lvgl/`, with the project name derived from the selected defconfig. This prevents a generated object from one chip ABI being reused by another target. Switching targets does not require removing another target's generated objects. Integration checks use the same target directory. Host builds use separate CMake build directories per Product.
