# Luban-Lite HMI Framework

> [中文版](README.zh-CN.md)

A lightweight HMI application framework for the ArtInChip Luban-Lite SDK (RT-Thread + LVGL 9). Several independent Products — industrial displays, touch control panels, device status terminals, CAN instruments — share one application runtime instead of each rebuilding it. Each firmware image builds exactly one Product. The Framework is made for Luban-Lite only; it is not a cross-vendor or cross-RTOS platform.

## Who owns what

| Layer | Owns |
|---|---|
| Luban-Lite SDK / BSP | Board configuration, pinmux, drivers (CAN, I2C, PWM, RTC, WDT, display, touch), RT-Thread, LVGL with GE2D/MPP, OTA burn/partition/ENV, mbedTLS |
| Framework (this repository) | The application runtime every Product needs: one runtime thread with the Product callbacks and a published snapshot for the UI, start-up in the SDK LVGL thread, settings persistence (EEPROM or file, debounced, power-loss safe), backlight and display colour, watchdog supervision of the runtime and UI threads, translation service, diagnostics shell, host simulator and build tools. Optional: CAN routing, per-bus transmit workers and periodic frames; CAN/UDS firmware update |
| Product (own repository) | Catalog, pages and assets, wording, communication protocols (CAN, UART, MCU links), business rules, peripherals the SDK does not cover, release identity |

A Product needs only a catalog and a UI; CAN, update and persistence are switched on by declaring them. Board facts come from the SDK defconfig ([board integration](docs/build/board-integration.md)); Products live in their own repositories ([Product integration](docs/product/downstream.md)); [SDK reuse](docs/runtime/reuse.md) records what the Framework takes from the SDK and why the rest stays.

## Host

```sh
python -m pip install -r tools/protocol/requirements.txt
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DHMI_BUILD_UI=ON
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Linux CI uses `ubuntu-latest`. Set `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy` for SDL runs.

## Product package

The reference Demo is the independent repository `boa-z/forklift-meter-platform-demo`, cloned into `products/demo`. The Framework tracks no Product: every Product, public or private, is its own repository cloned into `products/<id>` (ignored by the Framework, see [products/README.md](products/README.md)) or selected by an absolute path:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-private -DHMI_PRODUCT_ROOT=/path/to/product
```

Scaffold a Product with a catalog, an LVGL UI and local business only (add `--can` for a DBC-generated CAN decoder):

```sh
python tools/create_product.py --id my-product --output ../my-product
```

See the [Build and Product guide](docs/build/build.md) for Product manifests, SDK OneStep builds and optional CAN OTA composition.

## Firmware boundary

Platform common code lives in `contracts/`, `core/`, `runtime/`, `protocols/common/`, `ui/common/`; the RT-Thread port (one runtime thread plus TX, NVM, update and watchdog workers) is in `platform/rtthread/`, see [production runtime](docs/runtime/runtime-production.md). Firmware runs on the SDK's own LVGL 9 package (`lvgl-ui`, with its GE2D draw backend, MPP decoder, display and touch ports) and starts the Product UI from the SDK LVGL thread; the host simulator and tests build that same SDK LVGL source (`HMI_LVGL_ROOT` overrides the path). The lookup runtime for translations is the vendored `ui/common/i18n/lv_i18n` copy. The LVGL 9.6 port with its own display, touch and GE2D layer lives on the `dev/lvgl-9.6` branch.

## Documentation

Project documentation is bilingual: every first-party document ships `X.md` (English) and `X.zh-CN.md` (Simplified Chinese); update both together.

The CAN OTA host tool is the [meter-ota-host](https://github.com/boa-z/meter-ota-host) submodule at `tools/ota`. Configure with `-DHMI_PRODUCT_ROOT=` (empty) to build and test the framework without any Product.

## Diagnostics

See [Diagnostics and serial debugging](docs/runtime/diagnostics.md) for native ULog/MSH queries, structured trace, build identity and raw UART evidence.

See the [documentation index](docs/README.md) for current architecture, operating guides and validation records.
